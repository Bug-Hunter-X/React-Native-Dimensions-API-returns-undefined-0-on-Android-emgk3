This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue arises when the app is launched or when the screen orientation changes. Initially, `Dimensions.get('window').width` and `Dimensions.get('window').height` might return `undefined` or `0` because the dimensions haven't been fully determined yet. This leads to unexpected layout behavior or crashes if the app attempts to use these values before they're ready.
